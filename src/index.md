She was the president of the Mu chapter of Upsilon Pi Epsilon for a year, leading *ShellHacks*, Florida's Largest Hackathon, and she's hosted a few workshops on GitHub.

In her off time, she's an amateur musician. She plays the piano (badly) and the drums (not so badly).

She formerly worked under the name Matt Taylor. She appears in a multitude of photos online as a handsome young man.
