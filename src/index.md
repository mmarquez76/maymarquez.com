This site is a love letter to the "old Internet," an Internet spelled with a capital I, an Internet that consisted of thousands of individualized, quirky, strange little websites that sometimes served no purpose other than to experiment and delight in being connected with people around the world. 

Before the Internet became the same ten websites and apps that billions of people use, it was a messy, disorganized, disjointed collection of sites like this one. If you've never experienced that, try and imagine what it was like to hop onto your computer and just explore, purely for the sake of seeing what you could find this time.
