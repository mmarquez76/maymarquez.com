She specializes in backend optimization problems, parallel computing, and snazzy websites like these. She has a master's degree in computer science from Florida International University. She's proficient in a few different programming languages and frameworks (including, [unfortunately,](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) JavaScript). 

She was the president of the Mu chapter of Upsilon Pi Epsilon, leading *ShellHacks*, Florida's Largest Hackathon, along with a few other hackathons. She's hosted a few workshops on GitHub and C++. She's helped raise nearly **$400,000** for [COVID-19](https://ironmanfoundation.donordrive.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.event&eventID=683) [relief](https://events.doctorswithoutborders.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donate.personalCampaign&participantID=5485), [children](http://web.archive.org/web/20190906001609/https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&participantID=348756) with [disabilities](https://tiltify.com/+team-moonlight/tf2-binary-blackout), [LGBTQ youth](https://give.thetrevorproject.org/team/363190), [breast cancer research](https://tiltify.com/+team-moonlight/operation-peculiar-pandemonium), and [direct relief for Ukraine](https://tiltify.com/@potatomvm/rewiredrampage/donate) through various community fundraisers. 

She advocates for accessible gender-affirming healthcare for all, having written [an op-ed](https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/op-ed/article264182341.html) in the Miami Herald on the subject, and spends way too much time at local medical and school board meetings fighting for important causes.

In her off time, she's an amateur musician. She plays the piano (badly) and the drums (not so badly).

She formerly worked under the name Matt Taylor. She appears in a multitude of photos online as a handsome young man.
