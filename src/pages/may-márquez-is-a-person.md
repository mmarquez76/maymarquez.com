# May Márquez is a person.

She specializes in software design problems, parallel computing, hackathon organizing and IT infrastructure. She has a master's degree in computer science from Florida International University and is adept in a few different programming languages and frameworks (including, [unfortunately,](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) JavaScript). She has tried (and failed) to learn NixOS *at least* twice.

She was previously president of [INIT](https://www.weareinit.org/), a grassroots community organization focusing on tech education and professional development, where she helped organize *ShellHacks*, Florida's Largest Hackathon™. She has since volunteered with nearly a dozen other hackathons across North America, including by hosting workshops and talks on public speaking, professional development, GitHub, C++, and Linux.

She has helped raise nearly *$400,000* for [COVID-19](https://ironmanfoundation.donordrive.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.event&eventID=683) [relief](https://events.doctorswithoutborders.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donate.personalCampaign&participantID=5485), [children](http://web.archive.org/web/20190906001609/https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&participantID=348756) with [disabilities](https://tiltify.com/+team-moonlight/tf2-binary-blackout), [LGBTQ youth](https://give.thetrevorproject.org/team/363190), [breast cancer research](https://tiltify.com/+team-moonlight/operation-peculiar-pandemonium), and [direct relief for Ukraine](https://tiltify.com/@potatomvm/rewiredrampage/donate) through various online community fundraisers. She has written [an op-ed](https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/op-ed/article264182341.html) in the Miami Herald supporting gender-affirming care.  She is fiercely proud of the strange, challenging, beautiful state that shaped her and thinks it's worth fighting for.

In her off time, she experiments with the relationships between different sounds, chords, and rhythms. She plays the piano (badly), the bass (barely), and the drums (not so badly).

She formerly worked under the name Matt Taylor. She appears in a multitude of photos online as a handsome young man.
